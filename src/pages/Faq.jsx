      question: "What is ColorBrain?",
      answer:
        "ColorBrain is an AI model that can draw images from any text prompt!",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you keep it free?",
      answer:
        "The model requires a lot of compute so we rely on subscriptions and ads to pay for our servers.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you make images of higher quality?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we are constantly working on improving image quality. You can always try to do it multiple times but it should not affect much the result and will remain at the same resolution.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have any tips to create better images?",
      answer: `It's a good idea to be specific. Here are a few keywords that can be interesting to experiment with: "illustration", "photorealistic", "high definition"â€¦ We've seen so many cool tricks from the community so you should definitely check what others do for inspiration!`,
    },
    {
      question: "What to do when there is too much traffic?",
      answer: `We are increasing the number of servers as fast as we can so anybody can generate images with no issue. In the meantime, you may need to try a few times to generate images.`,
    },
    {
      question: "What if images do not appear?",
      answer: `Try a different device or browser, such as Google Chrome. You can also check if it works in incognito, clear your cache, and restart your phone or computer.`,
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI model work?",
      answer: `The model learns concepts from images. Each time you enter a prompt, it will create unique image based on its current knowledge and will try to combine the concepts from your prompt in a creative way.`,
    },
    {
      question: "What about limitations and biases?",
      answer: `While the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they may also reinforce or exacerbate societal biases. The model may generate images that contain harmful stereotypes. The extent and nature of the biases of the model have yet to be fully documented.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the images generated through ColorBrain?",
      answer: `Yes, as long as you respect the Terms of Use, feel free to use them as you wish for personal, academic or commercial use! Please credit colorbrain.com for the images.`,
