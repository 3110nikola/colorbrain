# Colorbrain

ColorBrain is a front-end project built with ViteJS, React, and Tailwind CSS that harnesses the power of the DALL-E API to create images using artificial intelligence. It allows users to generate unique and creative visuals by leveraging AI technology. Please note that ColorBrain is not associated with any real company or product. It is a fictional web application developed for educational purposes

## DALL-E API

ColorBrain utilizes the DALL-E API to produce images based on user inputs and AI-generated content. DALL-E is a powerful AI model that transforms text descriptions into corresponding images, enabling endless possibilities for creative expression.

The project draws inspiration from Craiyon website (https://www.craiyon.com/), and certain content, such as images, has been used for educational and demonstrative purposes. I do not claim ownership of their original content.
